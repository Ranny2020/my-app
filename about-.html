  The Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) was established by the Industrial Training
  Fund (ITF) in 1973.<br/> The scheme was initiated to address the problem of inadequate practical skills
  among graduates of tertiary institutions in Nigeria, which was affecting their employability in
  industries.<br/> The scheme was designed to expose and prepare students of universities, polytechnics,
  and colleges of education for the industrial work situation they would encounter after graduation.
  <br/>
  It provides students with the opportunity to handle and manage equipment and machinery
  that are usually not available in their institutions.
